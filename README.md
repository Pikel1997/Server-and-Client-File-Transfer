# Server-and-Client-File-Transfer
Python codes for the server and client end that facilitates file transfers. 

I will be using an AWS EC2 instance as the server and my local PC as the client.

Set the IP address as the IP address of your server

Make sure to allow your client IP in the inbound network rules.
